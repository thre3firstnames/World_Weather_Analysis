# World Weather Analysis & Vacation Planning using APIs
## Overview & Summary
Using the **OpenWeatherApp** API and several different **Google Maps** APIs, I successfully generated a list of world cities and pulled their most current weather data. Then, at PlanMyTrip’s request, I parsed the weather data and, within the bounds of an input temperature range **(50°F-80°F)**, assembled a list of hotels in those cites whose average temperature fell within the range. Finally, using the resulting hotel data, I plotted a driving trip of Spain, Northern Italy, and Portugal using Google’s Maps API capabilities.

This code can accept custom inputs for temperature ranges and could be easily refactored to plot driving directions for the other 684 cites in my database.
